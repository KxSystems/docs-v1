## Database tutorials

[A brief introduction to kdb+](http://code.kx.com/wiki/A_Brief_Introduction_to_kdb%2B) is a very quick overview of downloading kdb+ and running your first query.

[Sample queries](http://code.kx.com/wiki/Sample_Queries) has you build a more complex dataset in memory and perform some queries and joins on it. The dataset is from an imaginary desktop PC monitoring and helpdesk support system.

[On-disk queries](http://code.kx.com/wiki/On_Disk_Queries) has you download a set of scripts to build and run queries against a large on-disk database. The dataset is from an imaginary smart-meter network. It includes a basic HTML5 Business Intelligence tool which queries the database directly.

[_Kdb+ for Mortals_, Chapter 1](http://code.kx.com/wiki/JB:KdbplusForMortals/contents) by Jeffry A. Borror, gives a detailed explanation of how kdb+ databases are created, stored on disk and accessed from q.
