Kdb+ documentation
==================



This is Version 1 of the documentation site at [code.kx.com](https://code.kx.com).

It has now been frozen, but can be found online at [code.kx.com/q](https://code.kx.com/q/).

The current version of the site is in the `master` branch. 


Version 1.0
-----------

Rebuild of [code.kx.com/wiki](http://code.kx.com/wiki) using the [MkDocs](http://mkdocs.org) static site generator. 

The wiki enabled the kdb+ documentation to grow organically over the years. It is well organised for finding all uses of a word or glyph. 
Its replacement aims to 

- use a consistent vocabulary and typographical convention 
- distinguish clearly between a glyph and the function/s it denotes 
- categorise language primitives by application so, e.g. string-handling functions are listed together

Most of the wiki consists of three groups of articles:

- Reference
- Cookbook
- Extracts from V1 and V2 of _Q for Mortals_


## Local copy

If your Net connection is slow, you might prefer to download the site for local use from [code.kx.com/offline.zip](http://code.kx.com/offline.zip). 


## Reference 

The Reference articles have been exported from the wiki and their content incorporated into a hierarchical table of contents. Details on each q function are arranged in pages grouped under /ref by semantic topic: see _Reference/Semantics_ in the LHS navigation. 


## Cookbook 

The Cookbook articles have been migrated. 


## Q for Mortals V3

Unlike the first two editions, _Q for Mortals V3_ is now published in its entirety [online in HTML](http://code.kx.com/q4m3). 

Links from the Reference and Cookbook to _Q for Mortals_ have been replaced with links to _Q for Mortals V3_.


## Not upwardly compatible 

Rewriting the Reference material required settling the [vocabulary](http://code.kx.com/q/ref/glossary) in which q is described. 

The term _verb_ had been inherited from the [J programming language](http://jsoftware.com) but was an inexact fit for q, besides being unfamiliar to programmers generally. 

We start from the common usages of _operator_ and _function_; thus `+` is an operator. 

A function’s _rank_ is the number of arguments it takes. Functions of ranks 1 and 2 are no longer _monads_ and _dyads_ but (more familiarly) _unary_ and _binary_ functions. 

`+[2;3]` demonstrates that operators are also functions; a q operator is a binary function that may be applied infix. From this we discover `and`, `cut`, `upsert`, `over` and other functions are also operators. 

While _adverb_ is unfamiliar to programmers generally, and loses explanatory power outside the J noun/verb/adverb metaphor, we need a term for the q primitives that are applied postfix and return a derivative (derived function), e.g. `+/`. _Adverb_ survives by default, but we now improve clarity by distinguishing between the six glyphs and the twelve adverbs they denote.
```q
q)f:count':       / count is unary  so ': is each-parallel
q)g:,':           / ,     is binary so ': is each-prior
q)f("abc";"xyz")  / each-parallel derivative is unary
3 3
q)g["abc";"xyz"]  / each-prior derivative is binary
"xabc"
"yx"
"zy"
```
Adverbs take functions as arguments but are not alone in doing so: operators such as `fby`, `over`, and `scan` do so, as may any lambda. This is unremarkable in functional languages. 

K has _ambivalent_ primitives, e.g. `-` can be applied infix as the binary function _subtract_ or prefix as the unary function _negate_.
```k
  5-3
2
  -3
-3
```
Q has no ambivalent primitives, but some derivatives are ambivalent.
```q
q)tot:+/        / derivative
q)tot[til 6]    / unary
15
q)tot[2;til 6]  / binary
17
```
